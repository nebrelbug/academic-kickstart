Ben Gubler is interested in all things tech. Most of his programming is in JavaScript/TypeScript, but he also enjoys writing in Python, and sometimes Rust, Go, and C++.

He is the creator and lead developer of [Squirrelly](https://squirrelly.js.org) and [Eta](https://eta.js.org), two of the fastest JavaScript template engines. He is currently creating a Chrome Extension he plans to release soon.
